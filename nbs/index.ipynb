    "\n",
    "When establishing a connection, TCP uses a three-way handshake:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SYN**: Client sends a SYN packet with sequence number x\n",
    "2. **SYN-ACK**: Server responds with SYN-ACK (sequence y, acknowledgment x+1)\n",
    "3. **ACK**: Client sends ACK (acknowledgment y+1)\n",

    "\n",
    "TCP sockets go through various states:\n",
    "- CLOSED\n",
    "- LISTEN (server waiting for connections)\n",
    "- SYN_SENT (client initiated connection request)\n",
    "- SYN_RECEIVED (server received SYN)\n",
    "- ESTABLISHED (connection active)\n",

    "## Implementation Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "This project takes care to avoid common pitfalls when using the socket library:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Naming conflicts**: We use different attribute names (like `sock` instead of `socket`) to avoid confusion with the module name\n",
    "2. **Socket cleanup**: We ensure proper socket closure in all scenarios, including error conditions\n",
    "3. **Thread safety**: Our multithreaded design includes proper synchronization\n",
    "4. **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling for network operations\n",

    "This project contains several components:\n",

    "1. **Core**: Basic TCP types and utilities\n",
    "2. **Server**: TCP server implementations with various features\n",
    "3. **Client**: TCP client implementations with various features\n",
    "4. **Examples**: Practical demonstrations\n",
    "5. **Chat Application**: A complete TCP-based chat application\n",
    "\n",
    "## Server Types\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide several server implementations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TCPServer**: Basic TCP server that echoes messages\n",
    "2. **EnhancedTCPServer**: Server with custom message handling\n",
    "3. **EventDrivenTCPServer**: Server with event callbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Client Types\n",
    "\n",
    "The client implementations mirror the server capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TCPClient**: Basic TCP client \n",
    "2. **AsyncTCPClient**: Client with asynchronous message reception\n",
    "3. **EventDrivenTCPClient**: Client with event callbacks\n",
